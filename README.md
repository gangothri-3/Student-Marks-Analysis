**🎓 Student Marks Analysis**
A data analytics mini project completed during the APSSDC Internship: Data Analytics using Python, focused on analyzing students' academic performance using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

**📌 Project Overview**
This project analyzes student marks data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights such as:
- Average performance across subjects
- Subject-wise top performers
- Distribution of marks
- Correlation between subjects
- Pass/fail rates

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

**📂 Dataset**
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Name: Student name 
- Roll Number: Unique student ID 
- Subject1, Subject2, Subject3 : Marks in each subject
- Total: Total marks
- Result: Pass/Fail

**📊 Key Features**
-> Data cleaning and preprocessing
-> Calculating total and average marks
-> Visualizing subject-wise performance using bar graphs and pie charts
-> Identifying students who failed in any subject
-> Generating insights using correlation heatmaps

**🚀 How to Run**
- Clone the repository
- bash
git clone https://github.com/gangothri-3/Student-Marks-Analysis.git
- Open analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook 
- Run all cells to generate the analysis and visualizations

**📈 Sample Visuals**
Subject-wise Performance

**🏁 Conclusion**
This project helped me understand data analysis from a practical standpoint—right from data collection to visualization. It reflects my ability to use Python tools to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

**📜 Certificate**
This project was part of the certified internship program by APSSDC on Data Analytics Using Python.
